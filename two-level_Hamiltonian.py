# ##=================== KE function ===================##
# 
# For 3 qubits [q0, q1, q2], we first use q0 & q1 simulantously to undergo the kinetic circuit. 
# 
# Then, we use q1 & q2. The pattern goes on for bigger systems.
# 
# Typically,
# 
# 1) q0 is a control for X and q1 is a traget
# 
# 2) Rz(- pi /2) on q0
# 
# 3) q1 is a control for X and q0 is a traget
# 
# 4) Ry(- hopping angle) on q0
# 
# 5) q1 is a control for X and q0 is a traget
# 
# 6) Ry(+ hopping angle) on q0
# 
# 7) Rz(+ pi/2) on q0
# 
# 8) q0 is a control for X and q1 is a traget
# 
# 
# This makes sense because the kinetic term is just hopping from one location to the next.
# So, in general for n qubits, we will connect the i-th qubit with the i-th + 1 qubit..
# 
# It would be function of qc, hopping angle (hopping parameter h*dt), and the number of qubits.

# Now, let's add electromagnetic (E1) interaction to this system.
# Here, we are building the Unitary Time Evolution circuit for the E1 transition.
# The idea is to encode the entire electromagnetic field into one qubit, 
# which we refer to as an 'auxiliary qubit.' 
# Why only one? Because it has a narrow spectrum for interaction,
# and the interaction occurs within a cavity, 
# so we are only interested in photon modes of 1 (indicating the presence of a photon) 
# and photon modes of 0 (indicating no photon). It only takes one qubit!
# 
# We are going to sandwich the Unitary Time Evolution (U) circuit of the E1 transition between two X-gates.
# Why? Because using two X-gates transforms our circuit from its current form into the required form. Please check Nillsen&Chung (2nd Ed. Ch 4 section 3) for details. 
# Additionally, we need to apply U once and then Uâ€  (the conjugate transpose of U) afterward since everything must remain unitary
